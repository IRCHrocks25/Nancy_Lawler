## CONTENT MAPPING: Original Copy → Current Codebase

### HOMEPAGE SECTIONS

#### 1. HERO SECTION
**Original Copy:**
- Headline: "AI Is Easy to Use. Understanding Its Consequences Is Not."
- Subhead: "Across sports organizations, AI tools are being adopted quickly and informally. They promise speed, efficiency, and competitive advantage. What's harder to see is how everyday use compounds across teams, tools, data, and time. LawlerAI helps sports organizations understand where AI is already in play, what exposure it creates, and how to move forward with clarity and control."
- CTA: "👉 Explore Your AI Exposure"

**Current Implementation:** `includes/hero.html`
- ✅ Headline matches
- ⚠️ Subhead is condensed/paraphrased (similar meaning, different wording)
- ✅ CTA present

**Status:** NO DUPLICATE - Content is present but slightly condensed

---

#### 2. WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
**Original Copy:**
- "Most organizations didn't set out to 'adopt AI.' They simply started using it. Marketing experiments. Ticketing looks for efficiency. Operations move faster. IT and Legal work to keep up. Each decision feels small. The consequences are not. Without shared visibility and accountability, AI use spreads faster than leadership can assess its impact."

**Current Implementation:** `includes/whats_happening.html`
- ✅ Core message matches
- ✅ Examples listed (Marketing, Ticketing, Operations, IT & Legal)
- ✅ "Each decision feels small. The consequences are not." - Present
- ✅ Visibility/accountability message - Present

**Status:** NO DUPLICATE - Content matches with minor rephrasing

---

#### 3. THE HOPSCOTCH EFFECT
**Original Copy:**
- "Inside many sports organizations, AI adoption looks less like a strategy and more like hopscotch. Teams jump from tool to tool. Experiments start and stop. Different departments solve the same problem in different ways. Nothing feels dangerous in isolation. Over time, data fragments, accountability blurs, and exposure accumulates. The issue isn't innovation. It's a movement without a governing frame."

**Current Implementation:** `includes/hopscotch_effect.html`
- ✅ "Hopscotch" concept matches
- ✅ "Teams jump from tool to tool" - Present
- ✅ "Experiments start and stop" - Present
- ✅ "Different departments solve the same problem in different ways" - Present

**Status:** NO DUPLICATE - Content matches with minor rephrasing

---

#### 4. WHY THIS IS HARD
**Original Copy:**
- "AI doesn't behave like past technology. Small actions scale quickly. Data doesn't move in straight lines. Outcomes aren't always visible when decisions are made. Traditional controls weren't designed for this pace or ambiguity. Blocking tools doesn't work. Ignoring the problem doesn't work. Buying more technology doesn't solve it. What's needed is clarity. Before acceleration."

- "Once organizations understand where AI is already in use, and where risk is accumulating, strategy becomes possible. LawlerAI helps leadership translate visibility into a clear AI strategy: what AI should be used for, where it creates real value, which tools are appropriate, which workflows should change, and which should not. All strategy is developed inside your existing environment. This isn't a theoretical roadmap. It's a practical strategy grounded in your operating reality, governance posture, and business priorities. From there, we help organizations: evaluate and select tools responsibly, improve workflows with intent, align teams around shared direction. Strategy isn't about moving faster. It's about moving together, with purpose."

# FULLY REVISED HOMEPAGE COPY (FINAL)
## LAWLERAI

### AI Is Easy to Use. Understanding Its Consequences Is Not.

Across sports organizations, AI tools are being adopted quickly and informally. They promise speed, efficiency, and competitive advantage.

What's harder to see is how everyday use compounds across teams, tools, data, and time.

LawlerAI helps sports organizations understand where AI is already in play, what exposure it creates, and how to move forward with clarity and control.

👉 **Explore Your AI Exposure**

---

### WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING

Most organizations didn't set out to "adopt AI."

They simply started using it.

- Marketing experiments.
- Ticketing looks for efficiency.
- Operations move faster.
- IT and Legal work to keep up.

Each decision feels small.

The consequences are not.

Without shared visibility and accountability, AI use spreads faster than leadership can assess its impact.

---

### THE HOPSCOTCH EFFECT

Inside many sports organizations, AI adoption looks less like a strategy and more like hopscotch.

- Teams jump from tool to tool.
- Experiments start and stop.
- Different departments solve the same problem in different ways.
- Nothing feels dangerous in isolation.

Over time, data fragments, accountability blurs, and exposure accumulates.

The issue isn't innovation.

It's a movement without a governing frame.

---

### WHY THIS IS HARD

AI doesn't behave like past technology.

- Small actions scale quickly.
- Data doesn't move in straight lines.
- Outcomes aren't always visible when decisions are made.
- Traditional controls weren't designed for this pace or ambiguity.

Blocking tools doesn't work.

Ignoring the problem doesn't work.

Buying more technology doesn't solve it.

**What's needed is clarity. Before acceleration.**

### WHERE LAWLERAI OPERATES

LawlerAI works above tools and systems, helping organizations regain visibility and judgment.

We work within closed systems and existing controls, and when external tools are appropriate, we help organizations introduce them deliberately: with clear safeguards, accountability, and visibility.

The goal is not to slow innovation.

**It's to make progress defensible.**

---

### FROM CLARITY TO STRATEGY

Once organizations understand where AI is already in use, and where risk is accumulating, strategy becomes possible.

LawlerAI helps leadership translate visibility into a clear AI strategy:

- what AI should be used for
- where it creates real value
- which tools are appropriate
- which workflows should change, and which should not

All strategy is developed inside your existing environment.

This isn't a theoretical roadmap.

**It's a practical strategy grounded in your operating reality, governance posture, and business priorities.**

From there, we help organizations:

- evaluate and select tools responsibly
- improve workflows with intent
- align teams around shared direction

**Strategy isn't about moving faster.**

**It's about moving together, with purpose.**

## ORIENTATION PAGE + SURVEY QUESTIONS

### Before You Go Further

AI is already being used inside most sports organizations.

Often informally.

Often unevenly.

Often without shared visibility.

What feels like experimentation at the team level can quietly create exposure at the organizational level. Understanding where you stand, before scaling use, changes the quality of every decision that follows.

This short reflection is designed to help you assess how AI is currently showing up inside your organization, and whether leadership has the clarity and control it needs to move forward responsibly.

### What This Is

- A short, structured reflection
- Designed for leaders, operators, and advisors inside sports organizations
- Focused on visibility, accountability, and readiness

### What This Is Not

- Not a sales pitch
- Not a tool demo
- Not a compliance audit

There are no right or wrong answers.

The goal is clarity.
