THE HOPSCOTCH EFFECT
Inside many sports organizations, AI adoption looks less like a strategy and more like hopscotch.
Teams jump from tool to tool.

Different departments solve the same problem in different ways.
Nothing feels dangerous in isolation.
Over time, data fragments, accountability blurs, and exposure accumulates.
The issue isn’t innovation.
It's a movement without a governing frame.
