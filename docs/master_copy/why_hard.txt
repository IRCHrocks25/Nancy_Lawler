WHY THIS IS HARD
AI doesn’t behave like past technology.
Small actions scale quickly.
Data doesn’t move in straight lines.
Outcomes aren’t always visible when decisions are made.
Traditional controls weren’t designed for this pace or ambiguity.
Blocking tools doesn’t work.
Ignoring the problem doesn’t work.
Buying more technology doesn’t solve it.
What's needed is clarity. Before acceleration.
