Before You Go Further
AI is already being used inside most sports organizations.
Often informally.
Often unevenly.
Often without shared visibility.
What feels like experimentation at the team level can quietly create exposure at the organizational level. Understanding where you stand, before scaling use, changes the quality of every decision that follows.
This short reflection is designed to help you assess how AI is currently showing up inside your organization, and whether leadership has the clarity and control it needs to move forward responsibly.
What This Is
A short, structured reflection
Designed for leaders, operators, and advisors inside sports organizations
Focused on visibility, accountability, and readiness
What This Is Not
Not a sales pitch
Not a tool demo
Not a compliance audit
There are no right or wrong answers.
The goal is clarity.
